\item{background_groups}{Character vector: names of the background group(s)}

\item{group_id}{Name of the colData(sce) column in which the id of the group is defined}
}
\value{
UMAP plots showing the expression of gene of interest, compared between a group of interest and background groups
}
\description{
\code{make_featureplot}  Make a panel of UMAP plots showing the expression of a gene of interest in the group of interest vs other groups
