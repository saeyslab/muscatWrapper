\usage{
make_target_violin_plot(sce, target_oi, celltype_oi, group_oi, group_id, sample_id, celltype_id, covariate_oi = NA, background_groups = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{sce}{SingleCellExperiment object of the scRNAseq data of interest. Contains both sender and receiver cell types.}

\item{target_oi}{Name of the gene of interest}

\item{celltype_oi}{Character vector with the names of the celltype cell type of interest}

\item{group_oi}{Character vector of name of the group of interest}

\item{group_id}{Name of the meta data column that indicates from which group/condition a cell comes from (in both sce_receiver and sce_sender)}

\item{sample_id}{Name of the colData(sce) column in which the id of the sample is defined}

\item{celltype_id}{Name of the column in the meta data of sce that indicates the cell type of a cell.}

\item{covariate_oi}{Name of a covariate of interest based on which the visualization will be split. Default: NA: no covariate.}

\item{background_groups}{Default NULL: all groups in the group_id metadata column will be chosen. But user can fill in a character vector with the names of all gruops of interest.}

\item{celltypes_oi}{Character vector with the names of the celltype cell types of interest}
}
