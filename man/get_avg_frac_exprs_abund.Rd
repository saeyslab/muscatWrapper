\usage{
get_avg_frac_exprs_abund(sce, sample_id, celltype_id, group_id, covariates = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{sce}{SingleCellExperiment object of the scRNAseq data of interest. Contains both sender and receiver cell types.}

\item{sample_id}{Name of the meta data column that indicates from which sample/patient a cell comes from (in both sce_receiver and sce_sender)}

\item{celltype_id}{Name of the column in the meta data of sce that indicates the cell type of a cell.}

\item{group_id}{Name of the meta data column that indicates from which group/condition a cell comes from (in both sce_receiver and sce_sender)}

\item{covariates}{NA if no covariates should be corrected for. If there should be corrected for covariates, this argument should be the name(s) of the columns in the meta data that indicate the covariate(s).}
}
\value{
List containing data frames with average and fraction of expression per sample and per group (and pseudobulked), and relative cell type abundances as well.
}
\description{
\code{get_avg_frac_exprs_abund}  Calculate the average and fraction of expression of each gene per sample and per group. Calculate relative abundances of cell types as well.
